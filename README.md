# Movie-Recommendation-System
We now live in what some call the “era of abundance”. For any given product, there are sometimes thousands of options to choose from. Think of the examples: streaming videos, social networking, online shopping; the list goes on. Recommender systems help to personalize a platform and help the user find something they like.

The easiest and simplest way to do this is to recommend the most popular items. However, to really enhance the user experience through personalized recommendations, we need dedicated recommender systems.

A content-based movie recommender system that recommends movie on the basis of genres and by the analyses of the reviews given by the user.

# Summary
The movies are recommended based on genres of the movie you entered or selected. It also shows the description of the movie along with cast and their information. The reviews of the movie are taken from IMDB API and the reviews are subjected to sentimental analysis, where the model predicts whether the review is positive or negaive. And at the last top 5 movie will be recommended and clicking on this movies will redirect to new page and recommendation is done according to that particular movie.
